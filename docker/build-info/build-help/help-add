This command let's you add a new frame to a list

mikua add list LIST-NAME NAME LINK 

The name option reffers to what mikua will call this frame 
and the LIST-NAME will tell mikua where to put the frame

The data downloaded from this frame will be put in
/downloads/NAME

However you can put a custom location from root and the end of the command

mikua add list LIST-NAME NAME LINK /home/EXAMPLE/downloads
